            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of TechCon begins in 2012, when a group of tech enthusiasts who coincidentally lost their jobs decided to come together and provide a forum where people with interests in technology can meet and network. What started as a gathering with 15 people quickly grew, and now TechCon is one of the most anticipated conferences in the world.</p>
